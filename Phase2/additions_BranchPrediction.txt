new Branch prediction module

IF stage: 
The mux is now used to select between:
The predicted PC (if the branch is predicted taken, use target_pc).
The resolved branch target (from the EXE stage) if a branch decision is made.
The default sequential PC (PC + 4) if no branch is predicted or resolved.
