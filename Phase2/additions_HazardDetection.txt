Hazard Detection Unit

PC: The program counter is modified to use the PCWrite signal generated by the HDU.

IF stage: updated to work with the new PCwrite signal passed to the PC from the Hazard Detection Unit

ID stage: added branch taken logic

IF_ID_REG: The IF/ID register now respects the IF_ID_Write signal from the HDU to prevent updates during a stall.

ID_EXE_REG: The ID/EX register incorporates the Stall signal to insert a NOP (bubble) into the pipeline when a hazard is detected.

full pipeline: changed the above, added HDU to code
